Promp 1) Create a restaurant. You will hvae customers come into the restaurant. The restaurant has three
waiters that wait on 5 different tables. There is one chef. The waiters seat the customer, take the order,
bring the order to the chef, and then bring the food to the customer once it is ready. The customers eat and 
then leave the restaurant. Use interface/abstract to design this. You should use at least one generic method 
or class, and use multi-threading to do this. Show how this runs with customers eating for random amounts of time. 


The output: 
it should look like this, implemented in multi-threading 
{ One example
    waiterOne seats a customer on tableOne
    waiterOne takes an order 
    waiterOne brings order to the chef 
    waiterOne brings food to the customer
    customer eats 
    customer leaves 
} 

{ Second example 
    waiterTwo seats a customer on tableTwo
    waiterTwo takes an order 
    waiterTwo brings order to the chef 
    waiterTwo brings food to the customer
    customer eats 
    customer leaves
}
